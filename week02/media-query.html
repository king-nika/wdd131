            <p>
                Let no man be afraid to lay down his life for my sake; for whoso layeth down his life for my sake shall
                find it again. And whoso is not willing to lay down his life for my sake is not my disciple.

            <h1>1 Timothy 4: 12-16</h1>
            <p>
                Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in
                charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
                doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of
                the hands of the presbytery. Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting
                may appear to all. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this
                thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
